# About

This project is aimed at displaying workable skills in React.

It will show a web page with a search box, which will fetch data from an external api and display it in a pretty manner.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing

* Download and install a recent version of Nodejs
* Open a command line and navigate to the projects main folder (the same folder that the README.md is in)
* run `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
